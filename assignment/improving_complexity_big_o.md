1. The big O complexity of the combine algorithm is N. 
The complexity of the sort algorithm is n^2. So, the combined complexity is N+N^2, or simply O(N^2).

2. The big O complexity of the combine algorithm is N. 
The complexity of the merge sort algorithm is NlogN
The combined complexity is N + NlogN, or simply O(NlogN)

3. The complexity of the combine algorithm is N. 
The complexity of the buble sort algorithm is N^2. 
The combined complexity is N+N^2, or simply O(N^2). It saves space, though!

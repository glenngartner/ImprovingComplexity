Improving an Algorithm's Complexity
--

Bloc assignment for improving an existing algorithm's complexity

Answers are contained in the ~/assignment directory

- Version 1 optimizes the algorith, but does not improve its complexity

- Version 2 improves the complexity of the algorithm by using merge-sort

- Version 3 improves the space complexity of the algorithm, by sorting in-place using bubble sort

Big-O file lists the complexity of each algorithm
